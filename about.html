<h1>{{page.title}}</h1>

<p> Hey there! I'm Victor, a software engineer at Raytheon. I'm interested in blockchain, cybersecurity, and the Internet of Things.
    I am an alumnus of Tufts University with a degree in Electrical Engineering. When I'm not coding, you can find me running marathons,
    fingerpicking my guitar, and petting Jack, my orange American shorthair cat. I enjoy traveling to Vietnam and listening to audiobooks.

    Why the foxes? Apart from being cute, foxes are known for being highly agile and adaptable.They can be found in many continents
    around the world, from the arid deserts of Northern Africa to the frigid Artic tundra and everything in between. As a first-generation
    American, college student, white-collar professional, and marathoner, I've crafted my life by being just as flexible and driven. Hence, the fox. &#128522;
